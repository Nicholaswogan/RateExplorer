# Zahnle data

This folder holds Kevin Zahnle's thermodynamic data and reactions. Details are also documented in this repository: https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/ImpactAtmosphere/blob/main/ImpactAtmosphere/data/notes.md

# 10/2/23

I have added thermodata121.rx on the basis of the following email of Kevin Zahnle on 9/29/23. We chose new enthalpies of formation for CH3O and H2COH based on [Xu et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.5b00553). Xu gives enthalpies at 0 K, but we can convert them to 298 K following this website: https://cccbdb.nist.gov/enthform2.asp
