I have added thermodata121.rx on the basis of the following email of Kevin Zahnle on 9/29/23:

> Xu did a very good job taking all the available data into account, so i think I have to trust him. I've changed my thermodynamics! CH3O is now +29, and H2COH is now -9. I've introduced thermodata121.rx. This is an exciting day.

Here, Kevin is referring to [Xu et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.5b00553).
